                            <h3>PEDROS</h3>
           <p>Pedros is a flame grilled Portuguese chicken franchise, particularly well-known in Kwazulu-Natal. Since hearing of their Long Street branch opening recently, I decided to pop in and see what the hype is all about. As Long Street is a prime location, off street parking may be a problem during peak hours.</p>
       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
           <p>Welcome to Pedros Flame Grilled Chicken, the home of all things Pedros. Online ordering, visit our stores or browse our Menu...In Portugal, the rooster is a symbol of faith, justice and good luck. </p>
